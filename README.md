# Trading App

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJackey351%2FTradingApp)

A production-grade React + TypeScript SPA for a crypto trading application. This project features real-time data from Binance, a live order book, a TradingView chart, and persistent position tracking.

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular and scalable architecture, separating UI, state management, and data services.

- **User Interface (UI Components)**: Contains all user-facing visual elements, such as the instrument selector, order book, TradingView chart, trade ticket, and positions widget.
- **State Management**: Uses Zustand as a global state manager. All critical application data (like the current trading pair, order book data, and positions) is stored here.
- **Data Layer**: The `BinanceAdapter` is the data adapter responsible for communicating with the Binance API to fetch all trading data.
- **External Data Sources**: Represents the real data sources, namely Binance's REST API (for historical data) and WebSocket (for real-time streaming).
- **Development & Tooling**: Lists the tools that support development, building, and quality assurance, such as Vite, ESLint, and Husky.

### Core Data Flow

- **User Interaction**: User actions on UI components (e.g., selecting a trading pair) trigger updates to the Zustand store.
- **State-Driven UI**: Changes in the Zustand store's data drive the UI components to re-render, displaying the latest data.
- **Data Fetching**: The Zustand store calls the `BinanceAdapter` to subscribe to or fetch data.
- **Data Update**: After the `BinanceAdapter` receives data from the Binance API, it updates the Zustand store, completing the data loop.

## Core Features

- **Instrument Selector**: Switch between different trading pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT).
- **TradingView Chart**: Advanced charting library with custom data feed integration from Binance.
- **Live Order Book**: Real-time, virtualized order book to handle high-frequency updates efficiently.
- **Trade Ticket**: Mock order placement using the best available bid/ask prices.
- **Positions & PnL Widget**: Track your positions and unrealized profit/loss, with data persisted in `localStorage`.
- **Connectivity Resilience**: Robust WebSocket handling with automatic reconnection logic.
- **Strict Code Quality**: Enforced by ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript with pre-commit hooks.
